    <h2>Wildlife &amp; Habitat</h2>
    
<p>
There are many species of whales and dolphins found in the Islands Unit of the Monument. Some of these species are year-round residents of the Mariana archipelago, while others are seasonal visitors or merely transit through the area.
</p>
<p>
The researchers spotted the life forms at depths up to 6.6 miles within the Sirena Deep of the Mariana Trench National Wildlife Refuge. Recent studies indicate that by trapping particles from the water, xenophyophores can concentrate high levels of lead, uranium and mercury and are thus likely highly resistant to large doses of heavy metals. They are well suited to a life of darkness, low temperature and high pressure in the deep sea.
